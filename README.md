# Group1-Project-SDEV120

This repository is a collection of files used in a student project to develop a simple, 
Python-based payroll calculation program over the course of the semester.

Program Files:
    main.py - Start here! Main module. It contains a text-based menu and calls to other module files.
    calculation.py - Contains functions used to calculate and output payroll info for each employee.
    inputs.py - Contains functions used to view and edit the employee database file.
    employee_records.json - Test file containing employee records, stored in JSON format.


Planning and Documentation:
    Program Pseudocode.txt - Outline of the program's logic.
    output original (edited and merged into calculations).txt - Initial code from one contributor who left 
          partway through the design process. (One module wasn't incoprporated due to design changes,
          so both are included here for posterity.)
    Testing Documentation.xlsx - Spreadsheets documenting testing scenarios and outcomes.
    initial program hierarchy flowchart.drawio - An early outline of proposed modules and how they relate.
